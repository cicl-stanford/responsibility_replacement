Since each craftsman agreed to do their essential step why would there be a difference in responsibility when each person is tasked with a necessary job.,19,Male,Asian and White,Non-Hispanic,6715,439077,8/20/21 4:18

"I believe that it does not matter how busy the people are or how many available workers there were -- each craftsperson had a choice, and because they each said yes and did their part, they were both equally very important to the success of the project. Without any one person, regardless of how busy they were or how much demand there was, the project would be a failure. Therefore, every worker is very much important to the success.",21,Female,White,Non-Hispanic,6693,575406,8/23/21 18:37
"Every single time, I said that both craftsmen were very much responsible for the success no matter how busy one of them was or how many craftspeople of each type resided on their respective islands because the task was a two person job, and both had to do their own tasks in full. Regardless of how inopportune it was for one of them to help out, the end result (the completed boat) was a creation of the both of them.",19,Male,White,Hispanic,6737,658427,8/24/21 0:11

I would look at the relative busyness of each profession and compare it to the people saying yes - I did feel like being able to see everyones responses each round would have helped in my assessment of level of responsibility ,22,Male,White,Non-Hispanic,6749,636167,8/26/21 23:29
"Every ship requires one of each craftsmen to build it. They are equally responsible for the success regardless of the supply and demand.

I wasn't sure how to respond in all cases. At first I thought I should say both people were very much responsible because it takes two craftspeople to make a ship. Then I felt like I had to scale the rest of my responses to that.,19,Male,Asian,Non-Hispanic,6756,441542,9/25/21 1:28

My question regarding the experiment is: why does the number of workers and how busy they are matter, when at the end it is always 2 people putting in (presumably) an equal amount of effort and thus both equally responsible?",19,Female,Asian,Non-Hispanic,6788,636744,9/28/21 1:19
