I was influenced by the level of brittleness and how many machines they could have made as well as the risk taken. ,18,Female,Black/African American,Non-Hispanic,6963,378892,10/14/21 0:21

"The factors were if it was the best gear used and by the kinds of gears they had. Many had better gears to use but chose poor gears. However, there wear some towns that only had brittle gears and in that case they chose wisely because all of their gears were brittle and it would not have made a huge difference.",22,Male,White,Non-Hispanic,6955,1238131,10/14/21 21:23
I wasn't exactly sure what it meant for a gear to be responsible for the success - did it succeed everytime even though one was very brittle. I'm interpreting it so that if a less brittle gear was chosen out of a majority of less brittle gears then it wasn't as responsible because any other gear could be chosen and will succeed.,20,Female,Asian,Non-Hispanic,6784,485383,10/14/21 23:54

"The definitions were pretty unclear, but I basically thought about gears' relative importance in terms of their relative likelihood of being the tipping point gear; to formalize, perhaps the chance that that the rest of the gears of the same color break AND that that gear does not break when assembling the machine.",20,Male,Asian,Non-Hispanic,6759,561368,10/16/21 2:23
"One factor that determined how I evaluated responsibility was whether there were other gears of the same or more durability that could have done the same job. The 'rarer' a high durability gear was, the more likely I was to rate it as having more responsibility. If there was a lone gear that would have left the machine broken otherwise, this gear also ranked high on responsibility.",21,Male,White,Hispanic,6778,634780,10/17/21 2:20

"A green gear was more useful than a red one, and the more rare green ones were, the more useful they were. Also, if there was one of each color (yellow or blue), then they were very useful since the machine wouldn't be complete without them.",21,Female,Asian,Non-Hispanic,6789,429623,10/18/21 7:04

"As I made more and more decisions, I came to realize that a low green bar was just as likely to fail as a high red bar. I did not realize this fact until late in the experiment. ",20,Male,Asian,Non-Hispanic,6951,425657,10/19/21 23:01
The gears in most cases are equally responsible for the success since you need two gears for the machine to work.,19,Male,White,Non-Hispanic,6977,453284,10/21/21 7:07
"I just figured that if a gear is in the final machine, then it is 100% responsible for the success.",20,Male,Asian,Non-Hispanic,6805,320678,10/21/21 8:55
"Because all the machines were successful, I rated the gears all fairly high regardless of if they were brittle or not.However, I rated green gears higher since durability means it most likely will support the machine longer.",18,Female,Asian,Non-Hispanic,6824,325231,10/22/21 0:28

"If the village had a lot of other gears, especially less brittle gears, the impact of the individual gear felt less important. If one gear in the machine was more brittle than the other gear in the machine, the contribution of that gear also felt less important.

"I think I may have misunderstood this study. I gave every gear a very much because if it was used in the end for the machine and it was successful, wouldn't they all equally contribute very much to the machine?

The majority of my responses were based on how close the two gears being used were in terms of brittleness. The least responsible pairings would be a gear that is not brittle with one that is brittle because the breaking of the brittle one would effectively put the nonbrittle one out of use. ,22,Male,White,,6970,524578,10/25/21 21:49
"Factors influencing how I decided to respond: (1) how many gears were present, (2) how many good gears were present relative to brittle ones, (3) if there was only one green gear relative to others.",20,Female,Asian,Non-Hispanic,6848,243592,10/26/21 3:35

"If it was less brittle, it would be more responsible as it has a higher chance of guaranteeing success. If there were more, I decreased the amount it was responsible. ",19,Female,Asian,Non-Hispanic,6847,1530240,10/26/21 6:18

I believe that all of the gears contributed equally to the success of the machine regardless of how brittle they were or how many. The fact that there is variety in ability and amount doesn't change the fact that they are both needed for success. ,19,Male,,Hispanic,6985,793797,10/31/21 22:03

"At first, I thought they would both be responsible regardless because both are required for the outcome. But then I switched to thinking that if one gear is a lot more brittle, then it is more responsible because if the machine breaks then it is probably because of that gear.",21,Female,White,Non-Hispanic,6876,519598,11/1/21 4:52

"I assumed the two sliders for the yellow and the blue gear were percentages that would add up together to be 100%. For all of them, I put that the yellow gear and the blue gear are equally (~50%) responsible for the success, regardless of brittleness because the brittleness does not matter if the gear is not broken. That is to say, a non-brittle yellow gear cannot provide ""success"" if there is no blue gear, so the success is evenly distributed to both parties.",22,Female,Asian,Non-Hispanic,7104,366528,1/5/22 0:29
"The number of gears available in each group was the main factor that influenced my response. In addition, the number of green-level gears (which would serve as a backup if the gear in question was broken) was significant. ",18,Female,Asian,Non-Hispanic,7009,266398,1/5/22 0:49
"I thought they should all be very much since both were responsible for the success no matter how brittle they are. However, since there were so many questions on relatively the same thing, I thought that must be too easy so I made it that the more brittle were slightly less responsible for the success.",19,Female,White,Hispanic,7016,434503,1/7/22 20:30
